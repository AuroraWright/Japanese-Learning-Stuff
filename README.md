# Misc Japanese learning stuff
This is stuff I've hacked up together/updated/worked on in some way to assist with learning Japanese using publicly available code.
Anki plugins are in the Anki folder, and there are a few AppleScripts in the respective folder as well. I'm not offering support for any of this but they might come in handy to someone.

- rtk_popup_dictionary: A fork of https://github.com/glutanimate/popup-dictionary by Glutanimate which can show a popup of all the Kanji in a given selection or in the first field of the card if the keyboard combo is used taking information from another deck. More information on AnkiWeb https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1103781053
- editor_no_autoplay: Avoids the card editor playing back audio files when they're pasted for more than a couple seconds. Code taken and updated from here https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/option-controlling-autoplay-of-audio-dropped-into-card-editing-window/3863/6
- browser_refresh: A fork of https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/tree/master/src/browser_refresh by Glutanimate which adds a shortcut (CMD + R) to refresh the card list in the editor.
- speed_focus_mode: A fork of https://github.com/glutanimate/speed-focus-mode by Glutanimate which adds the option to skip cards (useful in my case because with some cards I remember the answer only the second time I see the challenge)
- recordVN.scpt: AppleScript to be used to record audio from a VN using ffmpeg, it then adds the recording to the last created Anki card and refreshes the card editor. It can be used as explained here https://game2text.com/resources/macos/audio-to-clipboard/ or bound to a trackpad gesture with e.g. Multitouch or BetterTouchTool but just uses ffmpeg in the background. ffmpeg has to be installed (with e.g. homebrew and the path has to be changed if using an Intel mac). For the script to work Anki Connect has to be installed in Anki.
- screenshotVN.scpt: AppleScript based on code from here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5641587?answerId=30931554022#30931554022 that takes a screenshot with specific coordinates and optionally resizes it, then adds the screenshot to the last created Anki card and refreshes the card editor. It can be used as explained here https://game2text.com/resources/macos/audio-to-clipboard/ or bound to a trackpad gesture with e.g. Multitouch or BetterTouchTool. python3 has to be installed (with e.g. homebrew and the path has to be changed if using an Intel mac) and pyobjc has to be installed with pip. For the script to work Anki Connect has to be installed in Anki.
- screenshotOCRSender.scpt: AppleScript that just uses the macOS screenshot clipping tool and writes the screenshot to a Unix domain socket (to be used with https://github.com/AuroraWright/owocr )
