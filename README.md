# Misc Japanese learning stuff
This is stuff I've hacked up together/updated/worked on in some way to assist with learning Japanese using publicly available code.
Anki plugins are in the Anki folder, and there are a few AppleScripts in the respective folder as well. I'm not offering support for any of this but they might come in handy to someone.

- rtk_popup_dictionary: A fork of https://github.com/glutanimate/popup-dictionary by Glutanimate which can show a popup of all the Kanji in a given selection or in the first field of the card if the keyboard combo is used taking information from another deck. More information in this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ut4068/rtk_popup_anki_addon_based_on_popup_dictionary/
- editor_no_autoplay: Avoids the card editor playing back audio files when they're pasted. Code taken and updated from here https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/option-controlling-autoplay-of-audio-dropped-into-card-editing-window/3863/6
- browser_refresh: A fork of https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/tree/master/src/browser_refresh by Glutanimate which adds a shortcut (CMD + R) to refresh the card list in the editor.
- recordVN.scpt: AppleScript to be used to record audio from a VN using ffmpeg and copy it to clipboard. It can be used as explained here https://game2text.com/resources/macos/audio-to-clipboard/ or bound to a trackpad gesture with e.g. Multitouch or BetterTouchTool but just uses ffmpeg in the background. ffmpeg has to be installed (with e.g. homebrew and the path has to be changed if using an Intel mac).
- screenshotVN.scpt: AppleScript based on code from here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5641587?answerId=30931554022#30931554022 to be used to take a screenshot with specific coordinates, copying it to clipboard and refreshing the Anki card editor. It can be used as explained here https://game2text.com/resources/macos/audio-to-clipboard/ or bound to a trackpad gesture with e.g. Multitouch or BetterTouchTool. The coordinates in the first line of the script are VN/screen resolution/VM software specific, python3 has to be installed (with e.g. homebrew and the path has to be changed if using an Intel mac) and pyobjc has to be installed with pip. For the Anki editor refresh to work the above browser_refresh plugin has to be installed in Anki.
